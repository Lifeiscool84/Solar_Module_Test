# Build Error Fixes

This document summarizes the build errors that were encountered and how they were resolved.

## Error Type 1: Missing Helper Functions

**Problem**: The code was using message formatting helper functions that were referenced but not defined:
- `getSuccessMessage`
- `getFailureMessage`
- `getWarningMessage`

**Solution**: Added the helper functions to format status messages consistently with well-structured feedback:

```cpp
// Helper functions for message formatting
String getSuccessMessage(const String& action, const String& details = "", const String& nextStep = "") {
    String message = "Success: " + action;
    if (details.length() > 0) {
        message += "\n" + details;
    }
    if (nextStep.length() > 0) {
        message += "\n→ " + nextStep;
    }
    return message;
}

String getFailureMessage(const String& action, const String& reason = "", const String& solution = "") {
    String message = "Error: " + action;
    if (reason.length() > 0) {
        message += "\n" + reason;
    }
    if (solution.length() > 0) {
        message += "\n→ " + solution;
    }
    return message;
}

String getWarningMessage(const String& situation, const String& impact = "", const String& recommendation = "") {
    String message = "Warning: " + situation;
    if (impact.length() > 0) {
        message += "\n" + impact;
    }
    if (recommendation.length() > 0) {
        message += "\n→ " + recommendation;
    }
    return message;
}
```

## Error Type 2: Undefined QUICK_TRACK_PRESET

**Problem**: The `QUICK_TRACK_PRESET` constant was being used in the help text before it was defined in the code.

**Solution**: Moved the `PresetConfig` structure and `QUICK_TRACK_PRESET` constant definitions to earlier in the file, placing them just after the command alias definitions.

## Error Type 3: Switch Statement Jump Issues

**Problem**: The switch statement in the `handleClient` function was jumping over variable initializations, causing compiler errors.

**Solution**: Replaced the problematic switch statement with if-else blocks to avoid jumping over variable initializations:

```cpp
// From this (problematic):
String collectionStateMsg;
switch (currentDataCollectionState) {
    case COLLECTING_ACTIVE:
        collectionStateMsg = "ACTIVE";
        // Add elapsed time variables...
        // ...
        break;
    case COLLECTING_PAUSED:
        // ...
}

// To this (fixed):
if (currentDataCollectionState == COLLECTING_ACTIVE) {
    String collectionStateMsg = "ACTIVE";
    // Variables initialized in the correct scope
    // ...
}
else if (currentDataCollectionState == COLLECTING_PAUSED) {
    String collectionStateMsg = "PAUSED";
    // ...
}
```

## Result

After implementing these fixes, the build was successful with no errors. The firmware was compiled successfully and is ready for deployment.
