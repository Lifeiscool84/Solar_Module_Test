- **Basic electronics knowledge** (I2C, sensors, power management)

### Getting Started in 5 Steps

1. **Hardware Validation**
   ```cpp
   // Upload and run the I2C scanner
   // File: scripts/data_analysis/i2c_scanner.cpp
   ```

2. **Validate Your Current Sensors**
```cpp
   // Use the sensor validation template
   // File: testing/hardware_validation/sensor_validation_template.cpp
   ```

3. **Explore Reference Implementation**
```cpp
   // Review the complete three-sensor system
   // File: firmware/reference_implementations/sd_power_monitoring_reference_implementation.cpp
   ```

4. **Add New Sensors**
```cpp
   // Copy and customize the sensor driver template
   // File: templates/sensor_drivers/sensor_driver_template.h
   ```

5. **Integrate Multiple Sensors**
```cpp
   // Use the multi-sensor integration template
   // File: templates/integration_examples/multi_sensor_template.cpp
   ```
