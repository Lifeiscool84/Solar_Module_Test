# Croc Tracker Development Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the professional development workflow for the Croc Tracker project, designed to support scalable multi-sensor integration and maintain high code quality standards.

## Development Philosophy

As your embedded software mentor, I've structured this workflow based on 20 years of industry experience. The key principles are:

1. **Iterative Development**: Start simple, validate early, expand systematically
2. **Documentation-Driven**: Document before coding, maintain during development
3. **Test-First Mentality**: Validate hardware before software, test continuously
4. **Modular Architecture**: Each sensor is independent, system is composable
5. **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture learnings for future reference

## Sensor Integration Workflow

### Phase 1: Hardware Validation
```
1. Physical Connection
   └── Verify power, ground, and communication lines
   └── Check I2C pull-up resistors (4.7kΩ)
   └── Measure supply voltages with multimeter

2. I2C Discovery
   └── Run I2C scanner to detect device address
   └── Document actual vs expected addresses
   └── Test communication reliability

3. Basic Communication Test
   └── Read device ID register
   └── Verify expected device ID values
   └── Test register read/write operations
```

### Phase 2: Driver Development
```
1. Create Sensor Directory
   └── hardware/sensors/[sensor_name]/
   └── Copy sensor_driver_template.h
   └── Update template with sensor specifics

2. Implement Core Functions
   └── Device initialization and configuration
   └── Data reading and conversion
   └── Error handling and validation

3. Create Examples
   └── Basic usage example
   └── Multi-sensor integration example
   └── Power optimization example
```

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
```
1. Unit Testing
   └── Test individual sensor functions
   └── Validate data accuracy and precision
   └── Test error conditions and recovery

2. Integration Testing
   └── Multi-sensor synchronization
   └── System-level data collection
   └── CSV logging validation

3. Performance Testing
   └── Power consumption analysis
   └── Timing and latency measurements
   └── Long-term stability testing
```

### Phase 4: Documentation and Knowledge Capture
```
1. Technical Documentation
   └── Configuration guide in documentation/configuration_guides/
   └── Integration guide in documentation/integration_guides/
   └── Troubleshooting notes in documentation/troubleshooting/

2. Knowledge Base Updates
   └── Lessons learned in knowledge_base/lessons_learned/
   └── Best practices in knowledge_base/best_practices/
   └── Research notes in knowledge_base/research_notes/
```

## File Organization Standards

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: snake_case (e.g., `sensor_driver.h`, `power_manager.cpp`)
- **Directories**: snake_case (e.g., `hardware_validation`, `sensor_configs`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `initSensor()`, `readTemperature()`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_CASE (e.g., `MAX_SENSORS`, `DEFAULT_CONFIG`)
- **Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `sensorData`, `measurementInterval`)

### Header File Structure
```cpp
/*
 * [filename].h
 * 
 * Brief description of purpose
 * 
 * Author: [Name]
 * Date: [Date]
 * Version: [Version]
 */

#ifndef [FILENAME]_H
#define [FILENAME]_H

// Includes
// Defines
// Data structures
// Function declarations
// Configuration macros
// Usage examples (commented)
// Troubleshooting notes (commented)

#endif // [FILENAME]_H
```

## Code Quality Standards

### Documentation Requirements
1. **Every function** must have a brief comment describing its purpose
2. **Complex algorithms** must include explanation comments
3. **Magic numbers** must be replaced with named constants
4. **Error conditions** must be documented and handled
5. **Hardware dependencies** must be clearly noted

### Testing Requirements
1. **Hardware validation** for every new sensor
2. **Unit tests** for critical functions
3. **Integration tests** for multi-sensor scenarios
4. **Performance benchmarks** for power consumption
5. **Long-term stability** tests for production deployment

### Error Handling Standards
```cpp
// Good: Explicit error checking with meaningful messages
bool initSensor(uint8_t address) {
    if (!validateI2CAddress(address)) {
        Serial.println("ERROR: Invalid I2C address");
        return false;
    }
    
    if (!devicePresent(address)) {
        Serial.println("ERROR: Device not detected");
        return false;
    }
    
    // Continue with initialization...
    return true;
}

// Bad: No error checking
void initSensor(uint8_t address) {
    // Assume everything works...
}
```
