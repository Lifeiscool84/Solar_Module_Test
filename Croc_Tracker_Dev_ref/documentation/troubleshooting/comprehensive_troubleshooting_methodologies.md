## Methodology Selection Guide

### When You Don't Know Where to Start: **Always Begin Here**

**1. Sequential Thinking** *(My #1 Go-To Method)*
- **When**: Every problem, always start here
- **Why**: Prevents jumping to solutions, ensures systematic approach
- **How**: Break problem into logical steps before taking action
- **Origin**: Computational thinking + structured problem solving

**2. Problem Severity Triage**
```
CRITICAL (System Down): Binary Search + Change Analysis
HIGH (Major Feature Broken): 5 Whys + Fault Tree Analysis  
MEDIUM (Performance Issue): Systems Thinking + Profiling
LOW (Enhancement/Optimization): PDCA + Hypothesis-Driven
```

---

## Phase 1: Problem Discovery & Analysis

### 1. Sequential Thinking Framework
**Origin**: Computational thinking methodology
**When to Use**: Start of every debugging session
**Time Investment**: 5-15 minutes upfront, saves hours later

**Process**:
```
1. Define the problem clearly (What is vs. What should be)
2. Gather observable symptoms and data
3. Identify what's known vs. unknown
4. Plan investigation approach
5. Set success criteria for resolution
```

**Example**:
```
Problem: "Arduino randomly crashes during SD card writes"
Sequential Thinking:
1. Define: System resets unpredictably during SD operations
2. Symptoms: No specific pattern, sometimes works fine
3. Known: Crashes only during writes, not reads
4. Investigation: Check power supply, memory usage, timing
5. Success: 24+ hours operation without crashes
```

### 2. Five Whys Analysis
**Origin**: Toyota Production System (Sakichi Toyoda, 1930s)
**When to Use**: Root cause analysis of any issue
**Time Investment**: 10-30 minutes per issue

**The Toyota Process**:
```
1. Write down the specific problem
2. Ask "Why did this happen?" and write the answer
3. If answer doesn't reveal root cause, ask "Why?" again
4. Repeat until you reach the root cause (usually 5 iterations)
5. Address the root cause, not just symptoms
```

**Real Embedded Systems Example**:
```
Problem: I2C communication fails intermittently

Why 1: Why does I2C fail?
→ Because we get NACK responses from slave device

Why 2: Why do we get NACK responses?
→ Because the slave device isn't responding to its address

Why 3: Why isn't the slave responding to its address?
→ Because the device resets during communication

Why 4: Why does the device reset during communication?
→ Because voltage drops below brown-out threshold

Why 5: Why does voltage drop during I2C communication?
→ Because pull-up resistors are too weak, causing excessive current draw

ROOT CAUSE: Incorrect pull-up resistor values (10kΩ should be 4.7kΩ)
```

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Stopping too early at symptoms
- Asking "who" instead of "why" (leads to blame, not solutions)
- Not validating each "why" with data

### 3. Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)
**Origin**: Kaoru Ishikawa, 1960s quality control
**When to Use**: Complex problems with multiple potential causes
**Best For**: Team brainstorming, multi-disciplinary issues

**Categories for Software/Hardware**:
```
- People: Skills, training, communication
- Process: Development methodology, testing procedures
- Environment: Temperature, power, EMI, workspace
- Tools: Compilers, IDEs, test equipment, libraries
- Materials: Components, libraries, documentation
- Methods: Algorithms, protocols, coding standards
```

**Example Structure**:
```

                   optimization
                   bugs
```

### 4. Change Analysis
**Origin**: Kepner-Tregoe methodology
**When to Use**: Something was working, now it's not
**Key Question**: "What changed?"

**Systematic Approach**:
```
1. Define exactly when problem started (timestamp)
2. List ALL changes in timeframe:
   - Code changes (git log)
   - Configuration changes
   - Hardware changes
   - Environmental changes (power, temperature)
   - Library/dependency updates
3. Test reverting each change systematically
4. Identify the change that introduced the problem
```

**Efficiency**: Reduces search space by 50% each iteration

**Process**:
```
1. Identify the boundaries (known good/bad points)
2. Test the midpoint
3. Narrow to the half containing the problem
4. Repeat until problem is isolated
```

**Applications**:
- **Code**: Comment out half the code, test, repeat
- **Git**: `git bisect` to find problem commit
- **Hardware**: Disconnect half the circuits, test, repeat
- **Data**: Test with half the dataset, repeat
- **Time**: Narrow down when problem started

### 6. Rubber Duck Debugging
**Origin**: "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Hunt & Thomas
**When to Use**: When stuck, need fresh perspective
**Why it Works**: Explaining forces clear thinking

2. Explain what you expect to happen
3. Explain what actually happens
4. Walk through code/system step by step
5. Explain your assumptions (often wrong!)
6. Ask the duck questions
```

**Pro Tips**:
- Use a real person if available (even better than duck)
- Record yourself explaining (can replay later)
- Draw diagrams while explaining
- Question every assumption out loud

### 7. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
**Origin**: Bell Labs (1960s), used in aerospace and nuclear
**When to Use**: Safety-critical systems, complex failure modes

2. Identify immediate causes using AND/OR gates
3. Break down each cause into sub-causes
4. Continue until reaching basic events
5. Calculate failure probabilities if needed
```

**Example for Embedded System**:
```
                     System Failure
                          |
                     [OR Gate]
                    /     |     \
            Power Fail  Software  Hardware
                |        Crash     Fault
           [AND Gate]      |        |
          /         \   Watchdog   Component
    Brown-out   Overvoltage Fail   Failure
```

2. Define what would prove/disprove it
3. Design minimal test to validate
4. Run test and measure results
5. Accept, reject, or refine hypothesis
6. Iterate until root cause found
```

**Example**:
```
Hypothesis: "I2C failures are caused by EMI from PWM signals"
Test: Disable PWM, measure I2C success rate
Result: Failures persist → Hypothesis rejected
Next: "I2C failures are caused by insufficient bus capacitance"
Test: Add 100nF caps to I2C lines, measure success rate
Result: Failures eliminated → Hypothesis accepted
```

### 10. PDCA Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act)

## Conclusion: The Meta-Methodology

After 25 years of debugging everything from microcontroller firmware to distributed systems serving billions of users, I've learned that **the methodology you choose matters less than applying it systematically**.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Always start with Sequential Thinking** - plan before you debug
2. **Question assumptions** - they're usually wrong
3. **Use data, not intuition** - measure, don't guess
4. **Focus on root causes** - fix the disease, not symptoms
5. **Learn from every problem** - build institutional knowledge
6. **Share knowledge** - help the team grow stronger

**The Ultimate Truth**: Most debugging problems are solved by **thinking clearly**, not by having the perfect tool or methodology. The techniques in this guide are frameworks for clear thinking under pressure.

**Remember**: You're not just fixing today's problem - you're building skills and knowledge to prevent tomorrow's problems.
